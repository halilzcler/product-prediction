# Product Prediction

<p>&emsp;In this python file I will test prediction algorithms. After testing according to their accuracy scores, I will compare them with each other and thus I will see which prediction algorithm is the best fit for this kind of situation, then I will use that algorithm for  We will use 5 classification algorithms for our test. KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian NB and Logistic Regression algorithms is going to be used for this prediction program.</p>
<br>  
<p>&emsp;In the end of the test we will find best prediction algorithm for our dataset and use that algorithm for prediction</p>
